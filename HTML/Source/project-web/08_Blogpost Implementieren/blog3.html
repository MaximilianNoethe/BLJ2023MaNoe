            <h1>MELIODAS ON TOP</h1>
            <p>
              Meliodas is a phenomenal character, celebrated for his intricate
              depth, profound emotional connections, and a captivating
              redemption arc, making him one of the finest protagonists in
              anime. In contrast, Gojo falls short in comparison, with a
              relatively one-dimensional character and an overconfident persona
              that often overshadows his character's substance.
            </p>

              <td>

                  <li>
                    <h6>Gojo's Overconfidence:</h6>
                    Gojo might be overpowered, but his overconfidence is his
                    weakness. He struts around like a peacock, while Meliodas
                    handles his power with more humility and restraint.

                  <li>
                    <h6>Gojo's Fashion Sense:</h6>
                    Gojo's fashion choices are as outrageous as his combat
                    abilities. His eccentric taste in clothing makes Meliodas's
                    iconic armor look stylish and practical in comparison.

                  <li>
                    <h6>Gojo's Isolation:</h6>
                    Gojo seems more isolated, while Meliodas thrives in a world
                    filled with complex relationships and emotional depth. Maybe
                    Gojo should open up his heart a bit more.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h6>Gojo's Bland Backstory:</h6>
                    Gojo's backstory is about as interesting as plain white
                    rice. Meliodas, on the other hand, has a rich and compelling
                    history that keeps fans engaged.

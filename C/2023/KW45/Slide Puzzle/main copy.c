/**
 * This programm depicts an all-time classic, the sliding puzzle. The one and
 * only 0 represents the empty slot in the sliding puzzle. Moves (sliding up,
 * down, left, right) are always made relative to the empty slot e.g. in the
 * case of the initial state of the field, only the moves left (swap 0 with 15)
 * and up (swap 0 with 8) can be made. This programm doesn't detect whether the
 * field is sorted. It runs as long as the user doesn't enter a 0.
 *
 * @return 0 if the programm was successfully run.

// TODO: Implement the rules for the sliding puzzle. In other words,
// swap neighboured values (horizontally or vertically) in the 2D array
// based on user input, but only if the move is legal (bounds checking).
